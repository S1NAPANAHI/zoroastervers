# App Crash Fixes - Startup Issues Resolved

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ðŸ”´ **Critical Issue 1: Database Configuration Mismatch**
**Problem:** The app had two conflicting database classes:
- `ZoroasterDatabase` in `/data/local/database/` (incorrect)
- `ZoroasterversDatabase` in `/data/` (correct)

The `DatabaseModule.kt` was trying to inject the wrong database class, causing Hilt dependency injection to fail during app startup.

**Fix Applied:**
- âœ… Updated `DatabaseModule.kt` to use the correct `ZoroasterversDatabase` class
- âœ… Added proper `UserDao` provider method
- âœ… Removed the duplicate/incorrect database files

### ðŸ”´ **Critical Issue 2: Missing DAO Providers**
**Problem:** The `ZoroasterversDatabase` declared a `userDao()` method but the `DatabaseModule` didn't provide it to Hilt, causing injection failures.

**Fix Applied:**
- âœ… Added `UserDao` provider in `DatabaseModule.kt`
- âœ… Prepared commented templates for future DAO providers

### ðŸ”´ **Critical Issue 3: BuildConfig Access Issues**
**Problem:** `BuildConfig.DEBUG` and `BuildConfig.API_BASE_URL` might not be accessible during dependency injection, especially in release builds with ProGuard obfuscation.

**Fix Applied:**
- âœ… Added comprehensive ProGuard rules to preserve `BuildConfig` class and fields
- âœ… Added try-catch blocks in `NetworkModule` for safe BuildConfig access
- âœ… Added fallback values for critical configuration
- âœ… Added proper ProGuard rules for Hilt, Room, Retrofit, and Gson

## Files Modified

1. **`app/src/main/java/com/example/zoroastervers/di/DatabaseModule.kt`**
   - Fixed database class reference
   - Added UserDao provider
   - Updated database name for consistency

2. **`app/proguard-rules.pro`**
   - Added BuildConfig preservation rules
   - Added Hilt, Room, Retrofit, and Gson preservation rules
   - Comprehensive obfuscation protection

3. **`app/src/main/java/com/example/zoroastervers/di/NetworkModule.kt`**
   - Added safe BuildConfig access with try-catch blocks
   - Added fallback API URL
   - Added logging for debugging BuildConfig issues

4. **Removed Files:**
   - `app/src/main/java/com/example/zoroastervers/data/local/database/ZoroasterDatabase.kt`
   - `app/src/main/java/com/example/zoroastervers/data/local/database/PlaceholderEntity.kt`

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clean and Rebuild:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew build
   ```

2. **Install and Test:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   adb logcat | grep -E '(ZoroasterVers|Hilt|Room|FATAL)'
   ```

3. **Check for Success:**
   - App should start without immediate crash
   - Look for "Application started successfully with Hilt" in logs
   - Look for "onCreate completed successfully" in logs

## What Should Work Now

âœ… **App startup without immediate crash**  
âœ… **Hilt dependency injection working**  
âœ… **Database initialization working**  
âœ… **Network module initialization working**  
âœ… **Proper error handling and logging**  

## If Issues Persist

If the app still crashes, check the logcat output:

```bash
adb logcat | grep -E '(FATAL|AndroidRuntime|ZoroasterVers)'
```

Common remaining issues might be:
- Missing network permissions (already present in manifest)
- Theme/resource issues (check `values/themes.xml`)
- Compose version incompatibilities
- Missing Activity export declaration (already correct in manifest)

## Next Steps

Once the app starts successfully:
1. Test basic navigation between screens
2. Test authentication flows
3. Test database operations
4. Test network connectivity

The fixes applied should resolve the immediate startup crash. Any remaining issues would likely be runtime logic errors rather than dependency injection or configuration problems.
